Today is my last day at <a href="http://appendto.com/">appendTo, LLC</a>. I've been working with appendTo for over 2.5 years and have been doing a combination of architecture reviews, project work, staff augmentation, and preforming on-site and virtual remote trainings. 

I've learned a lot while at appendTo. I've grown in my confidence as a developer and a trainer and I've valued working alongside talented developers and friends. I appreciate the time I've been at appendTo, but it is time to move on.

<h3>
Going Out On My Own</h3>

I've decided to go out on my own and start my own business! This day comes with a mixed bag full of emotions. My company name is <strong>Manorism, Inc.</strong> I've purchased the manorism.net domain (haven't launched it yet) and hope to acquire the .com from its current owner.

My initial focus will involve creating several <a href="http://pluralsight.com/">PluralSight</a> videos and then I hope to branch out to do remote/on-site trainings, workshops at conferences, and some consulting on the side. I start on my 1st PluralSight course starting tomorrow and it should be available in about a month.

I'm not going anywhere and if anything else you should see more of me than you have previously ;) Again, thanks appendTo and keep your eyes open for Manorism, Inc.
