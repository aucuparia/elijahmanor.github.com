We first went out to eat and then came back home after the kids were in bed to do some relaxing watercolor painting.</p> <p>We had been brainstorming for quite some time about the subject of our painting... and then I came upon the above "jQuery Rocks" idea.</p> <p>Although I enjoyed adding some tech to my painting, I am thinking next time we do this activity, I will choose to paint a landscape or something less geeky :)</p> <p>A friend of mine suggested that I put it up on eBay... I wonder if anyone would even bid on it!?!</p>
