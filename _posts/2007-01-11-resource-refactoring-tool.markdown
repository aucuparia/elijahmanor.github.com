By default, Visual Studio has a way to localize the text in a ASP.NET page, but there is no tool for extracting the text from the code behind or app_code files, until now!<br><br>There is a great new program, <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/ResourceRefactoring" target="_blank">The Resource Refactoring Tool</a>, that helps you localize your .NET applictions.<br><br>Most recently, they have added support for localizing the code behind files in a Web Applications... which is what I have been waiting for.<br><br>I installed and tested the tool and it is has been very handy.
