Wait, what!?! __CSS for Developers__? Aren't developers supposed to know **CSS**? Yes, the title of this blog post and associated talk may seem odd at first, but I feel it reaches out to several audiences that need it... and one of those used to be **me**.

The more that I meet and build relationships with other Front-End Developers I'm starting to see a trend of really talented software developers moving towards Front-End development and trying as hard as they can to stay away from **CSS**.

Have you ever or do you currently think this...

## Novice Notion

For a minute, think about a Back-End developer that is transitioning to Front-End work...

**JavaScript** typically isn't too hard for them to grasp once they get past the dynamic and functional nature of the language.

**HTML** is easy enough for them to learn and typically they don't run into issues with markup as they build websites or webapps.

**CSS** seemed simple enough when going through a quick tutorial, but once they started trying to style something according to design it quickly become frustrating and overwhelming.

## Personas

It's a challenge to make a talk that provides values for a diverse experienced audience. So, I decided to try something new. I created 3 main personas <small>(based on <a href="https://randomuser.me/">Random User Generator</a>)</small> and referenced them throughout the talk as the material progresses.

<div class="clearfix" style="margin-bottom: 2em;"><img src="/assets/images/2015/Jun/junior-jacob.jpg" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; border-radius: 50%;" /> <strong>Junior Jacob</strong>: Jacob is a junior developer who is getting started with Front-End Development and trying to get his head around it. Image that he just finished watching a <a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/" target="_blank">PluralSight</a> or <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/" target="_blank">Treehouse</a> course on web development.</div>

<div class="clearfix" style="margin-bottom: 2em;"><img src="/assets/images/2015/Jun/back-end-brian.jpg" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; border-radius: 50%;" /> <strong>Back-End Brian</strong>: Brian is a back-end developer who understands software development really well, but CSS makes no sense to him and he tends to gravitate to Twitter Bootstrap instead of learning how CSS works.</div>

<div class="clearfix" style="margin-bottom: 2em;"><img src="/assets/images/2015/Jun/mid-level-melissa.jpg" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; border-radius: 50%;" /> <strong>Mid-Level Melissa</strong>: Melissa is a mid-level web developer who is proficient at CSS, but hasn't really kept her skills up-to-date. She can build most any site she is asked, but the CSS isn't organized very well or maintainable.</div>

## Tips, Techniques, and Tools

Thankfully with a some basic foundational concepts, modern techniques, and tooling we can raise the bar of our CSS understanding, organization, and maintainability.

<div class="flex-container">
  <ul class="flex-item">
    <li>Box Model</li>
    <li>Specificity</li>
    <li>Position</li>
    <li>Cascading</li>
    <li>Sizing</li>
  </ul>
  <ul class="flex-item">
    <li>Alignment</li>
    <li>Sass &amp; Sass Docs</li>
    <li>Atomic Design</li>
    <li>BEM</li>
    <li>Linting</li>
  </ul>
</div>
