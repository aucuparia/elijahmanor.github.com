<p>I ran across the following quote today and thought it was pretty funny…</p> <blockquote>  <p>3 Biggest Software Lies:</p>   <ol><li>The program’s fully tested and bug-free</li>     <li>We’re working on the documentation</li>     <li>Of course we can modify it!</li>  </ol></blockquote> <p>Do you have any other items to add to the above list? If so, please share them in the comments :)</p>
