<p>Due to popular demand I have started to publish my Twitter tech tweets to <a target="_blank" href="http://delicious.com/elijahmanor">my delicious profile</a>.</p>  <p>The original intent of the tech tweets was to share current technology news with those that might be interested.</p>  <p><a href="http://delicious.com/elijahmanor"><img title="delicious" border="0" alt="delicious" align="right" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_L6DiZQsfJzs/SfB5c0Y4YNI/AAAAAAAAGyo/T0DJNEQN3gw/delicious6.jpg?imgmax=800" width="149" height="143"></a> I have had feedback from several individuals (<a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/shanselman">@shanselman</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/calvinb">@calvinb</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/mallize">@mallize</a>) that delicious would be a good repository to complement my tech tweets so that someone could easily retrieve the links in the future.</p>  <p>If you are new to delicious, it is a social bookmarking service that allows you to post and share links to the world. You can learn more about it on delicious’ <a href="http://delicious.com/about">about page</a>. There are some really <a href="http://delicious.com/help/tools">useful tools</a> to make this more worth your while. </p>  <p><a href="http://twitter.com/elijahmanor"><img title="twitter" border="0" alt="twitter" align="left" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_L6DiZQsfJzs/SfB5db__1iI/AAAAAAAAGys/V9yFiA4fZno/twitter6.jpg?imgmax=800" width="130" height="130"></a>So, with the addition of delicious I think I will cease to post the weekly <a target="_blank" href="http://webdevdotnet.blogspot.com/search/label/Tech%20Twitterings">Tech Twitterings</a> blog post since the content should be much easier to locate on delicious.</p>  <p>Hopefully this can be a useful option for those that are interested in the tech tweets, but don’t want to <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/elijahmanor">follow me</a> on Twitter because of the quantity of my tweets :)</p>  <p>I have started a program to post a delicious link as soon as my tweets get posted, but in the meantime there will be a slight delay between my tweets and when it gets posted to delicious. </p>  <p>What do you think about this change? Do you find the tech tweets useful? Do you have a delicious account?</p>
