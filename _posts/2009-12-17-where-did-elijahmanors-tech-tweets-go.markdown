<p><a href="http://elijahmanor.com/webdevdotnet/image.axd?picture=TechTweetBird.png"><img title="TechTweetBird" border="0" alt="TechTweetBird" align="left" src="http://elijahmanor.com/webdevdotnet/image.axd?picture=TechTweetBird_thumb.png" width="240" height="233"></a> You might be wondering “Where Did <a href="http://twitter.com/elijahmanor" target="_blank">@elijahmanor</a>’s Tech Tweets Go?”. I actually wasn’t aware of this issue until I had several people asking where my tech tweets went. It seems that there is an issue with my account on Twitter today starting around 9AM CST.</p>  <p>In order to see my tweets there is a workaround of unfollowing and then refollowing me (<a href="http://twitter.com/elijahmanor" target="_blank">@elijahmanor</a>). This seems strange, but it has worked for those that have tried it.</p>  <p>You may have not noticed that this was a problem. If that is the case then maybe you were seeing my tweets as part of a Twitter search (which still works) or maybe I was part of a custom Twitter List that you are watching. </p>  <p>I hope that this is just a temporary glitch in Twitter that will resolve itself soon. I have created a Twitter Ticket explaining the issue just in case.</p>  <p>I will do my regular Tech Tweets blog post round-up as usual. So, if you didn’t see any of my tech tweets you can enjoy them there :)</p>  <p><strong>Update: </strong>On my way home today I noticed an update to the <a href="http://status.twitter.com/post/287676075/known-issues-timeline-delays-and-missing-tweets" target="_blank">Twitter Status Blog</a> stated that</p>  <blockquote>   <p>We are aware of and investigating the causes of timeline delays and missing tweets. Retweet is back up and fully functional.</p> </blockquote>  <p>So, I hope that means this will not last for long ;)</p>
