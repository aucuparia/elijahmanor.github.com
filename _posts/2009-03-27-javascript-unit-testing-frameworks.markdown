<p>Not only should you have unit tests for your User Interface & Middle Tier code, but you should also consider unit testing your JavaScript code.</p> <p>There are several different Unit Testing frameworks made for JavaScript that you have to choose from.</p> <p>Note: In future posts I will show examples of how to use each of these frameworks… as for now, this is just an introduction to the tools I’ll be covering.</p> <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="109"><strong>Framework</strong></td>       <td valign="top" width="335"><strong>Description</strong></td>    </tr><tr><td valign="top" width="113"><a target="_blank" href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/yuitest/">YUI Test</a></td>       <td valign="top" width="332">        <p>YUI Test is a testing framework for browser-based JavaScript solutions. Using YUI Test, you can easily add unit testing to your JavaScript solutions. While not a direct port from any specific xUnit framework, YUI Test does derive some characteristics from<a href="http://www.nunit.org/">nUnit</a> and <a href="http://www.junit.org/">JUnit</a>.</p>      </td>    </tr><tr><td valign="top" width="116"><a target="_blank" href="http://www.jsunit.net/">JsUnit</a></td>       <td valign="top" width="330">JsUnit is a Unit Testing framework for client-side (in-browser) JavaScript.
