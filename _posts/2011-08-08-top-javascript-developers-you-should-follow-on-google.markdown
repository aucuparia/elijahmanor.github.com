<a href="http://gpc.fm/l/javascript" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-duPruOoELgw/Tj_b9MkDK6I/AAAAAAAAKBM/Opi1lmq8mBM/s200/google_plus_logo.jpg" width="183" /></a>Like many of you, I've hopped on the <a href="https://plus.google.com/" target="_blank">Google+</a> bangwagon and the 1st thing you do on most social networks is to find those individuals that you want to follow.

As many of you are aware I work for <a href="http://appendto.com/">appendTo</a> and most of my work these days involves front-end web development ( JavaScript, jQuery, HTML5, etc ). 

So, I created the following list of <a href="http://gpc.fm/l/javascript" target="_blank">60+ JavaScript Developers</a> on the Google+ Counter website that you might consider circling ( a.k.a. following ).
<blockquote>
Unfortunately since the Google+ API is not yet released you'll have to click each developer and circle them one at a time. Once the API is released hopefully this will be much less painful.</blockquote>
<a href="http://gpc.fm/l/javascript" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-UWM4G3Gxhog/Tj_bhppzHvI/AAAAAAAAKBI/SpU5QXXVx60/s320/Top5JavaScriptGooglePlug.png" width="252" /></a>The top 5 individuals that are circled are listed in the image to the right. Hopefully these names are not a surprise to you as they are all highly influential in the JavaScript space.

Google+ is technically still invite only so I image these numbers will increase dramatically over time.&nbsp;I find Google+ already to be a much more conversational way to share knowledge.

Are you on Google+? If not I have <a href="https://plus.google.com/_/notifications/ngemlink?path=%2F%3Fgpinv%3D3rGtJSJ9jKQ%3AesHtanFxNlQ">some invites</a> left over. 

Also if you circle me ( <a href="http://gplus.to/elijahmanor">http://gplus.to/elijahmanor</a> )  I'll put you in my Developer circle and share with you the latest in web development links throughout the week. 

Am I missing your favorite JavaScript developer? If so, leave a comment and I'll see about adding them to the list.
