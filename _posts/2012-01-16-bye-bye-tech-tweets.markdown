As you probably noticed I haven't been blogging as much as I used to. With church, family, work, and tech tweets it seems my free time has dwindled down to nothing.
<div>

I want to refocus on blogging again for this year. Not only do I enjoy sharing the things that I learn, but by doing so I tend to learn the topic even better than I did in the first place. Also, many of my conference presentations are based off blog posts that I've authored previously.&nbsp;</div>

So, something needs to give for me to have extra time for blogging and giving up Tech Tweets is what I've chosen. Giving up Tech Tweets wasn't an easy&nbsp;decision&nbsp;for me because I've lived and breathed it for probably the past 5 years or so. It is now in my nature to scour the internet for the latest in front-end news. In order for this to work like I want to I'll need to resist the urge to research everything and share it immediately. I'll need to now depend on the others who are currently doing the research.&nbsp;</div>

Thankfully there are many other avenues to get similar information that I've been providing. Many great&nbsp;resources&nbsp;have cropped up recently that allow you to get front-end news, articles, and library information in a daily or weekly manner. I'll be blogging about what resources I recommend you to follow in the near future. These are the same resources that I'll be using to keep myself up to speed on what is going on.</div>

I am not giving up Twitter or anything. I still will be active on social media, but any tech tweets you see from me will probably be retweets from other resources or just interesting things that I came across that day. Who knows, I might get pulled back into the whole tech tweeting again, but even if I do I'd like to keep it somewhat unstructured.

Thank you all for following me and for regularly retweeting my tech tweets. I do appreciate it. My habbits are changing, but hopfully the posts will be of value to you as well. I have planned out numerous jQuery and jQuery Mobile posts that should keep me busy for quite some time.&nbsp;</div>

In addition to a renewed interest in blogging I will also focus on posting some content to the newly created&nbsp;<a href="http://freshbrewedcode.com/">Fresh Brewed Code</a>&nbsp;website where many of my friends from the Nashville area are now blogging. I don't have any posts there yet, but expect some very soon!</div>
