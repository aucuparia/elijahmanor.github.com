<p>Yesterday I posted my first short <a href="http://screenr.com/user/elijahmanor" target="_blank">Screenr</a> screencast </p>  <ul><li><a href="http://elijahmanor.com/webdevdotnet/post/Firefinder-Add-on-for-Firebug-Add-on-for-Firefox.aspx" target="_blank">Firefinder for Firebug for Firefox for Fiddling with jQuery</a></li> </ul><p>Today I decided to record another screencast, and I decided to dig into the <a href="http://firequery.binaryage.com/" target="_blank">FireQuery</a> add-on for <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1843" target="_blank">Firebug</a>. </p>  <p><a href="http://firequery.binaryage.com/" target="_blank">FireQuery</a> adds extra functionality to the HTML tab and allows you to visually see embedded data elements and event handlers that were added via jQuery. Also, the familiar <a href="http://www.learningjquery.com/2009/04/better-stronger-safer-jquerify-bookmarklet" target="_blank">jQuerify Bookmarklet</a> has been built into Firebug allowing you to inject jQuery into pages that didn’t have it installed previously. This enables you to play around with jQuery or extract information for a webpage that might not previously have jQuery installed.</p>   <p> </p>  <p>Yet again, I hope this was beneficial to you. If you enjoyed the presentation I would appreciate either a comment to this blog &| a tweet about it to share with others.</p>  <blockquote>   <p><a href="http://twitter.com/home?status=%22Digging+into+the+FireQuery+Add-on+for+jQuery%22+by+%40elijahmanor+%23tech+%23nettuts+%23jquery+%23screencast+http%3A%2F%2Fj.mp%2F1T9RKE+">"Digging into the FireQuery Add-on for jQuery" by @elijahmanor #tech #nettuts #jquery #screencast http://j.mp/1T9RKE</a></p> </blockquote>  <p>Also, if you have any suggestions that you have to help become a better presenter I would appreciate that as well. If you have a minute, please add a comment with your thoughts.</p>
