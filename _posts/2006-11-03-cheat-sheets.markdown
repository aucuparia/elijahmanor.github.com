I'm a big fan of Cheat Sheets. I currently have HTML, JavaScript, Regular Expressions, and CSS cheat sheets hanging up in my cube. I have plenty of other Cheat Sheets downloaded on my Thumb Drive.<br><br>If you are interested in collecting some Cheat Sheet as well you can find many of them from <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/cheat-sheets-static.html" target="_blank">Smashing Magazine</a>.
