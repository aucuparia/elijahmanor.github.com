<p>Tonight I created my first <a href="http://screenr.com/user/elijahmanor" target="_blank">Screenr</a> screencast showcasing the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/11905" target="_blank">Firefinder</a> Add-on for the popular <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1843" target="_blank">Firebug</a> Add-on for the even more popular <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/firefox.html" target="_blank">Firefox</a> browser :) Whew, that was a mouth full!</p>  <p>Firefinder is a helpful tool when creating a selector for jQuery, which is usually where you start for most jQuery work. In the following screencast I show how to use Firefinder in conjunction with the Firebug console window in order to add some animation effects to my blog on the mouse over and mouse out events.</p>   <p> </p>  <p>I hope you found this screencast helpful. There are many Firebug Add-ons that are useful for web development and I hope to extend this series to include several of the others. </p>  <p>If you enjoyed the above screencast I would appreciate it if you could retweet it by clicking the following and posted it to your Twitter account… thanks :)</p>  <blockquote>   <p><a href="http://twitter.com/home?status=%22Firefinder+for+Firebug+for+Firefox+for+Fiddling+with+jQuery%22+by+%40elijahmanor+%23tech+%23nettuts+%23jquery+%23screencast+http%3A%2F%2Fj.mp%2FZKtTT" target="_blank">"Firefinder for Firebug for Firefox for Fiddling with jQuery" by @elijahmanor #tech #nettuts #jquery #screencast http://j.mp/ZKtTT</a></p></blockquote>
