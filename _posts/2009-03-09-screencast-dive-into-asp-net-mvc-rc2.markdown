<br><a href="http://vimeo.com/3536652">Dive into ASP.NET MVC RC2</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/elijahmanor">Elijah Manor</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com/">Vimeo</a>.<br><p>Last week I gave a presentation at the Compuware Thought Leadership meeting entitled, "Dive Into ASP.NET MVC RC2".</p> <p>Several people asked me about the presentaiton and were interested in the material. However, the meeting was closed to only Compuware employees. So, I thought I would make a screencast of the talk.</p> <p>The screencast covers the following:  </p><ol><li>An quick overview of what is "MVC"</li><li>Pros & Cons comparing ASP.NET MVC to ASP.NET WebForms</li>  <li>Answers to questions you might be thinking</li><li>Review of new features since the beta release</li><li>Demonstration & code review of a demo app using ASP.NET MVC RC2</li></ol><p>Note: This is my first screencast, so please be patient with me :)</p> <p>You can download the sample ASP.NET MVC RC2 application demonstrated in the screencast... <a href="http://elijah.manor.googlepages.com/PetShop5Rc2.zip">PetShop5Rc2.zip</a></p>
