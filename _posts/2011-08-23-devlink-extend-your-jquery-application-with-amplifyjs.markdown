Last week I attended the <a href="http://devlink.net/">devLink conference</a> in Chattanooga, TN. On Thursday I gave a presentation entitled <i>Extend your jQuery Application with AmplifyJS.</i>

Thank you for everyone who was able to attend the session. Unfortunately the session was not recorded, but you can access <a href="http://j.mp/etm-amplifyjs-slides" target="_blank">my slides</a> and play around with the interactive jsFiddles that I demonstrated. You can launch the associated jsFiddles by clicking the "pencil" icon when you see one in the slide's title.

The session was a combination of the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/scriptjunkie/hh147623">Script Junkie article</a> I wrote, by the same name, and also some of the prototyping and unit testing concepts that I presented at the <a href="http://events.jquery.org/2011/sf-bay-area/">San Francisco jQuery Conference</a> earlier this year.
