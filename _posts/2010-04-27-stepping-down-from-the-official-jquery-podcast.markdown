I’ve been running on empty for quite some time and other more important things in my life have gotten the shaft! Unfortunately, one of those was my family and I intend to change that.</p>  <p>I don’t plan to fall off the face of the earth. I plan to refocus on blogging and tweeting. I would like to do some more speaking, but probably not for the rest of the year as baby #3 is coming in August.</p>  <p>I am honored to have been asked to join The Official jQuery Podcast and during my involvement I got to meet many great people that I hadn’t previously known. I am glad to have formed these relationships, and look forward to further investing in them.</p>  <p>I hope the future of <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-official-jquery-podcast/id339835419" target="_blank">The Official jQuery Podcast</a> is bright and I encourage you to either start or continue to listen. </p>
