Yesterday I presented at the jQuery Boston Conference 2010. I’ve never attended a jQuery Conference before, so this was an awesome experience all around. <br>Each year, there is a jQuery UI Introduction talk and this year I was privileged to present the material. <br><ul><li><a href="http://elijahmanor.com/talks/jq-ui-intro.html" target="_blank">Slides</a> – The web presentation is best viewed with Google Chrome</li></ul>In order to spice up the content some, I included some bacon demos using the draggable, droppable, and resize interactions. I hope to add more bacon slides in the near future ;)<br><br>If you were able to attend my talk, I would appreciate it if you could rate my presentation at <a href="http://speakerrate.com/talks/4643-introduction-to-jquery-ui" target="_blank">SpeakerRate</a>.<br><br>My slides are based on the <a href="http://slideshow.rubyforge.org/" target="_blank">Ruby Slide Show Gem</a> tool and uses a modified version of the HTML5 Rocks template that was used to generate the <a href="http://slides.html5rocks.com/" target="_blank">HTML5 Rocks Presentation</a>.<br><br>I use embedded <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/" target="_blank">jsFiddle</a> in my examples to view and execute all of my code example. You can launch the full jsFiddle from within the slides to view, edit, run, and share the code.<br><br>I want to thank the <a href="http://jquery.org/team" target="_blank">jQuery Team</a> for allowing me to speak this year and a special shout out to <a href="http://twiter.com/wifelette" target="_blank">Leah Silber</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/redwolves" target="_blank">Ralph Whitbeck</a>, and the others that put tons of hours into putting this event together.
