I jumped on the ASP.NET AJAX bandwagon when the Release Candidate came out. I've heard a lot about it ever since it was called 'ATLAS', but I had never played around with it until recently.<br><br>The <a href="http://ajax.asp.net/downloads/default.aspx?tabid=47">Official 1.0 Release</a> version came out on January 23, 2005 and the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=ef2c1acc-051a-4fe6-ad72-f3bed8623b43&DisplayLang=en">Full Source Code</a> became available today.<br><br>Along with the framework, you can download the <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ProjectName=AtlasControlToolkit">AJAX Control Toolkit</a>. You can demonstrate the controls from this toolkit on their <a href="http://ajax.asp.net/ajaxtoolkit/">test website</a>.<br><br>I am quite impressed at the easy, speed, stability, and breadth of the framework and controls. If you haven't played around with this yet, then you are missing out on some excitement!
