Steve Jobs just announced that Safari 3 has a Public Beta available for the Windows platform. You can grab the beta at <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/" target="_blank">Apple's download website</a>.<br><br>The Safari 3 Public Beta claims that it is...<br><blockquote cite="http://www.apple.com/safari/"><br>"The fastest web browser on any platform, Safari loads pages up to 2 times faster than Internet Explorer 7 and up to 1.6 times faster than Firefox 2.<br><br>And it executes JavaScript up to 2.8 times faster than Internet Explorer 7 and up to 1.6 times faster than Firefox 2."<br></blockquote><br><br>I am interested to see how the population responds to the new Windows Safari 3 browser. I wonder what changes, if any I will need to make to my websites to support Safari 3.
