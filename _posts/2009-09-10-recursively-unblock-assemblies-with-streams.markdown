<p><a href="http://elijahmanor.com/webdevdotnet/image.axd?picture=MvcContrib.png"><img title="MvcContrib" border="0" alt="MvcContrib" align="left" src="http://elijahmanor.com/webdevdotnet/image.axd?picture=MvcContrib_thumb.png" width="381" height="519"></a>Ever since my recent blog post <a href="http://elijahmanor.com/webdevdotnet/post/Unblocking-Assembly-Due-to-AspNetHostingPermission-Security-Exception.aspx" target="_blank">Unblocking Assembly Due to AspNetHostingPermission Security Exception</a> I have been pretty careful about unblocking Assemblies after downloading them from the internet.</p>  <p>However, today I decided to download the <a href="http://mvccontrib.codeplex.com/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=25281#ReleaseFiles" target="_blank">MVCContrib.Extras.release.zip</a> which has over 100 assemblies, pdbs, and xml files of which ALL are blocked by Windows 7!</p>  <p>Since there is no way to multi-select and unblock the files at once, I shuttered at the thought of right-clicking each file and unblocking them one by one. There has to be a better way… and to my fortune there is :)</p>  <p>The answer is yet another useful too from Sysinternals called <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb897440.aspx" target="_blank">Streams</a>.</p>  <p>Streams is a command line tool that lets you unblock one or more files at a time and you can even recursively perform unblocks! Yippee</p>  <p>Immediately I started to look for a feature to right-click folder option to open a command prompt at that location (like I used to with the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/Downloads/powertoys/Xppowertoys.mspx" target="_blank">Open Command Window Here</a> Microsoft Power Tool for Windows XP). </p>  <p><a href="http://elijahmanor.com/webdevdotnet/image.axd?picture=ShiftRightClick_8.png"><img title="ShiftRightClick" border="0" alt="ShiftRightClick" align="right" src="http://elijahmanor.com/webdevdotnet/image.axd?picture=ShiftRightClick_thumb.png" width="379" height="340"></a></p>  <p>I didn’t see an Open Command Window Here context menu for Windows 7 when I initially right-clicked on a folder, so I decided to do some quick research to see what is the best way to do this in Windows 7. </p>  <p>I was pleased to find that the feature is native in Windows 7, but I had just missed it. </p>  <p>It turns out that if you Shift-Right-Click on a folder then an "Open Command Window Here” context menu will appear! Apparently, this was a <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/tims/archive/2006/09/18/windows-vista-secret-1-open-command-prompt-here.aspx" target="_blank">feature</a> of Windows Vista too, but as I mentioned in a previous post… I upgraded immediately from Windows XP to Windows 7. </p>  <p>So, (after downloading Streams and registering it in my System Path Variable) I quickly typed in the following command to save the day.</p>  <pre>streams –s *.*</pre> <blockquote>  <h4>Using Streams</h4>   <p><strong>Usage: streams [-s] [-d] <file or directory></strong></p>   <p><strong>-s</strong>       <br>Recurse subdirectories.</p>   <p><strong>-d</strong>       <br>Delete streams.       <br>Streams takes wildcards e.g. 'streams *.txt'.</p></blockquote> <p> </p> <p>Anyway, I didn’t know about either the Streams command line too or the Shift-Right-Click “Open command window here” feature of Windows 7 and thought I would share them with you. Hopefully, they help someone ;) If not, it will help me remember them in the future.<a href="http://elijahmanor.com/webdevdotnet/image.axd?picture=ShiftRightClick_9.png"> </a></p>
