Check out these great <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vcsharp/programming/tools/">C# Programming Tools</a>! I knew about some of them, but there are many that I didn't even know existed and many of them are open source!<br><blockquote>"The C# Team has scoured the Web for other implementations of the CLI, cool object browsers, IDE tricks, add-ins, obfuscators, and other useful tools and utilities that will help you get your job done faster."</blockquote>
