It was great to meet you all. I enjoyed our conversations and your questions. I hope to see you all around at another conference in the near future! The following are the talks that I gave this past week.

<h3>Angry Birds of JavaScript</h3>

AngleBrackets was the first time I've given my Angry Birds of JavaScript talk based on the <strong><a href="http://elijahmanor.com/angry-birds-of-javascript-series/" target="_blank">blog series</a></strong> that ended yesterday. You can click the following image to see the slides.

<blockquote>I used the reveal.js slide presentation framework for my slides. You'll need to down-arrow down to drill into each topic and then right-arrow to the next topic. The last slide of the Red Angry Bird is an interactive game. You have to destroy both pigs before you can proceed to the next topic ;)</blockquote>

<h3>Introduction to Backbone.js</h3>

I've given this talk once before, but I tweaked the slides somewhat since then.
