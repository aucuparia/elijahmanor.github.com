<p>Last night I went to a local Microsoft Event demonstrating the cool new features of VSTS 2010 presented by <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/mmydland">Mark Mydland</a> (Principal Group Manager of VSTS Test).</p> <p>Mark demonstrated numerous new features of VSTS 2010 such as... </p><ul><li>Allowing the tester to automatically capture data to eliminate no-repro bugs</li><li>Allowing the developer to immediately navigate to the problem code</li><li>Creating automating test cases with coded UI test</li><li>And much more...</li></ul><p>In addition Mark demonstrated some products that have recently come out of Microsoft Research...</p><ul><li><a href="http://research.microsoft.com/Pex/">Pex</a> <blockquote>"Right from the code editor, Pex finds interesting input-output values of your methods, which you can save as a small test suite with high code coverage. Pex performs a systematic analysis, hunting for boundary conditions, exceptions and assertion failures, which you can debug right away."</blockquote> <p>If you are new to Pex, you might want to check out the following resources...</p>   <ul><li>watch the <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/posts/briankel/Pex-Automated-Exploratory-Testing-for-NET/">Pex Channel9 video</a></li>      <li>read the <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/pex/articles/pexcodediggertutorial.pdf">Code Digger Tutorial</a></li>      <li>watch the <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/pdc2008/TL51/">PDC 2008 video</a></li>   </ul><br></li><li><a href="http://research.microsoft.com/Chess/">CHESS</a>   <blockquote>"CHESS is an automated tool for finding errors in multithreaded software by systematic exploration of thread schedules. It finds errors, such as data-races, deadlocks, hangs, and data-corruption induced access violations, that are extremely hard to find with current testing tools. Once CHESS locates an error, it provides a fully repeatable execution of the program leading to the error, thus greatly aiding the debugging process."</blockquote> <p>If you are new to CHESS, you might want to check out the following resources...</p>   <ul><li>Listen to <a href="http://www.hanselminutes.com/default.aspx?showID=154">Scott Hanselman's interview at PDC</a></li>      <li>Watch the <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/pdc2008/TL58">PDC 2008 video</a></li>   </ul></li></ul><p>Feel free to download <a href="https://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/content/content.aspx?ContentID=9790&wa=wsignin1.0" target="_blank">Visual Studio 2010 and .NET Framework 4.0 CTP</a> and start playing with it today.</p> <p>Note: If you were unable to make this talk, then there is a PDC video covering most, but not all of the content entitled <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/pdc2008/TL47/" target="_blank">Microsoft Visual Studio Team System: A Lap Around VSTS 2010</a> by Cameron Skinner (Product Unit Manager on the VSTS team). Here is a brief description of the video...</p> <blockquote>"In the spirit of an agile sprint, see how to use the next version of Visual Studio Team System to manage user stories and re-factor existing architecture. Learn how to diagnose real production problems, debug in-production virtual labs, capture test data to eliminate the no-repro bugs, transparently plan, monitor, and adapt software projects."</blockquote> <p>Thank you <a href="http://www.compuware.com/">Compuware </a>for sponsoring the event!</p>
