<p>I recently started a Google Spreadsheet to include top resources for jQuery such as where to get started, great plugins, helpful tools, useful cheat sheets, quick tutorials, etc… (accessible via the tabs at the bottom of the spreadsheet)</p>    <p>I’ve only just begun to fill out the Spreadsheet, but I have already shown several people and told them I would post it online as a resource for them.</p>    <p>I hope to maintain this list not only for myself, but also to assist those that are looking for good resources. I envision more tabs being created in the near future (such as Unit Testing Frameworks, etc…)</p>     <p><strong>Note</strong>: Make sure to click the tabs at the bottom on the above spreadsheet... like the Tutorials, Plugins, Tools, Cheat Sheets, and whatever else might be there in the near future :)</p> <p>If you have a great resource you would like to recommend to this list, please leave a comment and I will consider adding it.</p>
