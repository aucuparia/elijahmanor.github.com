The time is coming for the 3rd [AngleBrackets](http://anglebrackets.org/) conference. I've been honored to  participate in the past 2 events and I look forward to the 3rd event in Orlando, FL. I'll be presenting 3 different sessions on front-end web development topics.

## Speakers

Some of the other speakers that you might recognize include Scott Hanselman, Scott Guthrie, John Papa, Dan Wahlin, Douglas Crockford, Denise Jacobs, Todd Anglin, and [lots of other talented speakers](http://anglebrackets.org/speakers.aspx).

## Discount Code

If you would like to attend either the [AngleBrackets](http://anglebrackets.org) (HTML/CSS/JavaScript) or [DevIntersections](http://devintersection.com/) (Microsoft Focused) you can use the `MANOR` discount code for $50 off your registration price.

**NOTE**: Registering for one event also gets you into the other event. They are held the same time and the same place.

## My Sessions

This year I'll be giving the following 3 presenations. 

* Fixing Common JavaScript Bugs
> In this talk I'll show JavaScript code snippets with common bugs we tend to encounter as we learn the language. We will expose the underlying issues, explain what is really going on, and then exterminate the problems. The goal of this session is to help you not make the same mistakes that I've made and in the process help you know what is really going on behind the scenes.

* Grunt-ify Your Front-End Web Development
> Front-end developers are using the Grunt task runner more and more. This talk will introduce Grunt, how to install it and get started, and then we will uncover common plugins and workflows, and then dive into advanced techniques to manage and organize the system when it gets large.

* jQuery-free JavaScript
> This talk looks at the concept of front-end web development without jQuery. Is that a crazy idea? Is it possible in today's modern browser landscape? What are the pros and cons? This talk has morphed over time and I hope it will fuel your decision to use jQuery or not in your next project.

## Hope to See You There

If you are able to attend the conference and are interested in front-end web dev, then I'd love to meet you. Feel free to stop me in the hallway or come up before or after my talks. I hope to see you there!
