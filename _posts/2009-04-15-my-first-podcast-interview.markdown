<p>A good friend of mine, Tanton Gibbs (<a href="http://twitter.com/tgibbs">@tgibbs</a>), from Microsoft has started a new Podcast series called <a href="http://newtechcast.com/">New Tech Cast</a>.</p> <blockquote>In these podcasts, I'm going to be interviewing up and comers in the software development world. These industrious developers will have their fingers on the pulse of today's tech and should provide great insight into the things to come.</blockquote> <p>I was flattered to be chosen for his first Podcast interview. In the podcast we discussed my history, various technologies that I use (<a href="http://www.asp.net/mvc/">ASP.NET MVC</a>, <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>, etc...), and a variety of other things.</p> <p>You can download and listen to the <a href="http://newtechcast.com/2009/04/podcast-with-elijah-manor.html">podcast</a> on his new website.</p>
