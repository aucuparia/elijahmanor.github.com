<p>I recently tweeted that I thought the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/syntaxhighlighter/" target="_blank">SyntaxHighlighter</a> is the best way to display code on your blog. In response, I had some who were a little confused how to get started with the tool. The tool isn't as straight forward as some other tools. There are <a href="http://developertips.blogspot.com/2007/08/syntaxhighlighter-on-blogger.html" target="_blank">several steps</a> you will need to take in order for it to work on your blog.</p>  <p>Since my tweet, I have reconsidered my initial recommendation for new users. The look and features of <a href="http://code.google.com/p/syntaxhighlighter/" target="_blank">SyntaxHighlighter</a> are nice, but it does take some setup on your blog, some manual manipulation of your code, and presents a slight delay during render time (since it is dynamically manipulated via JavaScript).</p><p>I plan to start using <a href="http://code.google.com/p/syntaxhighlighter/" target="_blank">SyntaxHighligher</a> from now on and I would recommend it for bloggers that post a lot of code, but if you an occasional code poster, then one of the following <a href="http://get.live.com/writer/overview" target="_blank">Windows Live Writer</a> plug-ins might be a better solution for you (they are much simpler and faster to render and takes no setup on your blog). All that said, you might even like the plug-ins better than <a href="http://code.google.com/p/syntaxhighlighter/" target="_blank">SyntaxHighlighter</a>... and hey, that's fine by me :)</p>  <p>The <a href="http://get.live.com/writer/overview" target="_blank">Windows Live Writer</a> plug-ins that I recommend are...</p><ul><li><a href="http://gallery.live.com/liveItemDetail.aspx?li=1f57bd9b-a692-4593-9e9e-e2962d9c0eee&bt=9&pl=8" target="_blank">Insert Code for Windows Live Writer</a></li>    <li><a href="http://gallery.live.com/liveItemDetail.aspx?li=d4409446-af7f-42ec-aa20-78aa5bac4748&bt=9&pl=8" target="_blank">Code Snippet plugin for Windows Live Writer</a></li>    <li><a href="http://gallery.live.com/liveItemDetail.aspx?li=d8835a5e-28da-4242-82eb-e1a006b083b9&bt=9&pl=8" target="_blank">Paste from Visual Studio</a></li> </ul>
