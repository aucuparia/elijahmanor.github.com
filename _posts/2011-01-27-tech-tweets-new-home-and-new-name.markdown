Based on some feedback from my friends and for some personal reasons I have moved Tech Tweets to another blog.<br><br>Here are some of the good things about it...<br><ul><li>I've changed the name of "Tech Tweets" to <a href="http://webdevtweets.blogspot.com/">Web Dev Tweets</a> since  the term is more accurate and also fits in the naming convention of  this site. <br></li></ul><ul><li>You can subscribe to either <a href="http://webdevtweets.blogspot.com/">Web Dev Tweets</a> (<a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/webdevtweets">RSS</a>) and/or <a href="http://www.elijahmanor.com/">Web Dev .NET</a> (<a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/WebDevnet">RSS</a>) separately via their own RSS feed </li></ul><ul><li>The <a href="http://webdevtweets.blogspot.com/">Web Dev Tweets</a> round-up posts no longer drown out my non-round-up posts on this blog</li></ul><br>I hope you find these changes helpful & that you find the tweets & roundup posts helpful as well.
