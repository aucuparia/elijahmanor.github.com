For those of you who don’t know about snippets or who are sad that c# didn’t come with many snippets installed, here is a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/downloads/codesnippets/">List of Microsoft Snippets</a> that you can install.<br><br>Once installed (double-clicking vsi files) you can access the snippets either by typing in their shortcut name and hitting tab twice or by clicking Ctrl-K-S.<br><br>I made a <a href="http://elijahmanor.tripod.com/CallMiddleTierMethod.snippet">custom SOAP snippet</a> using <a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/codegallery/codegallery.aspx?id=b0813ae7-466a-43c2-b2ad-f87e4ee6bc39">Snippy</a> to call a Web Service method from ASP.NET. To import my snippet use “Tools->Code Snippet Manager…->Import”. My snippet's shortcut is “soap”.<br><br>In addition, <a href="http://gotcodesnippets.com/">GotCodeSnippets.NET</a>, has a lot of other snippets submitted by the .NET community.
