I told many of you about this a month or so earlier, but I thought I'd mention it again since the deadline is coming up.<br><br>There is a <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2006/05/22/Red_2D00_Gate-SQL-Query-Intellisense-Tool-_2800_Free-Download_2900_.aspx">Free SQL Prompt Intellisense Tool</a> availble from <a href="http://www.red-gate.com/">Red-Gate</a> until September 1st.<br><br>Personally, I think this should have been part of Microsoft SQL Server 2005, but I guess it just didn't make the cut.<br>
