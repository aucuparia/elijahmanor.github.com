After much internal debate, today I decided to finally install IE8 Beta 2 on my local development machine.<br><br>Unfortunately, my initial experience was filled with annoyance and disappointment.<br><br><div><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_L6DiZQsfJzs/SMXhF0JN9ZI/AAAAAAAAERE/p-mSOH9pElI/s1600-h/Ie8Error.png" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_L6DiZQsfJzs/SMXhF0JN9ZI/AAAAAAAAERE/pf2UhRZRA_g/s400-R/Ie8Error.png"></a></div><br>I first became frustrated by a crazy warning that stated that "Internet Explorer is currently running with add-ons disabled. Click here to manage, disable, or remove your add-ons." Since it said all my add-ons where disabled I thought I'd go check them out, but when I looked all my add-ons were enabled!<br><br>After some trial, error, and Googling, I found that the Google Toolbar was the cultrpit and I needed to upgrade to Google Toolbar 5 Beta to resolved the crazy yellow warning. After upgrading, this error went away, and I was actually able to use the Google Toolbar, wheww...<br><br><div><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_L6DiZQsfJzs/SMXhOBZ7F_I/AAAAAAAAERM/fcwvUkSDW_8/s1600-h/IE8Error2.JPG" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_L6DiZQsfJzs/SMXhOBZ7F_I/AAAAAAAAERM/jt3jIY5kKvs/s400-R/IE8Error2.JPG"></a></div><br>As the day progressed, I started to notice some weird horizontal lines appearing in my browser. Apparently, IE8 Beta 2 wasn't fast enough to redraw certain parts of the web page, so I would these horizontal lines as I scrolled up and down.<br><br>I wasn't very impressed with the speed of the rendering as well. It did seem faster than IE7, but I guess I have been spoiled after using Google Chrome for the past week or so.<br><br>Stayed tuned and I will give you 'IE8 Beta 2 Pros' in my next post.
