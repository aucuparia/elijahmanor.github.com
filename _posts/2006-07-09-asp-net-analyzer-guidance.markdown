I ran across these free ASP.NET tools and thought I'd share them with you...<br><br>The <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=D2717206-E804-415E-9173-C7B7327289E4&displaylang=en">Best Practice Analyzer for ASP.NET</a> (alpha release)<br><blockquote cite="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/struct/tables.html#h-11.1">"...is a tool that scans the configuration of an ASP.NET 2.0 application. The tool can scan against three mainline scenarios (hosted environment, production environment, or development environment) and identify problematic configuration settings in the machine.config or web.config files associated with your ASP.NET application. This is an alpha release intended to gain feedback on the tool and the configuration rules included with it."</blockquote><br>The <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2006/06/29/Free-Patterns-and-Practices-Guidance-Explorer-for-ASP.NET-and-.NET.aspx">Patterns and Practices Guidance Explorer</a> <br><blockquote cite="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/struct/tables.html#h-11.1">"...is a tool to find and use relevant patterns & practices guidance.
