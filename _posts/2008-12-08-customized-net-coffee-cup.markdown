<p>My wife and I went out on a much needed date after a dry spell of alone time. I thought either we could do the typical movie thing, or maybe we could do something more interactive in nature.</p><p>So, with the help of my tweeters we came up with the idea of Painting Pottery at <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?rlz=1C1GGLS_en-USUS298US301&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&um=1&q=nashville+all+fired+up&fb=1&view=text&latlng=6987541081472075271&dtab=2&sa=X&oi=local_result&resnum=1&ct=result#">All Fired Up</a> in Nashville, TN.</p><p>Then comes the hard part what does a computer geek programmer paint on a piece of pottery? Ahh... well, computer geek terms of course!</p><p>Here are some pictures of the coffee mug that I painted. I plan to bring it to work and drink from it proudly :)</p><div><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_L6DiZQsfJzs/STzLrhDIM5I/AAAAAAAAGOU/QXWUYB0eCa0/s1600-h/IMG_0252.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_L6DiZQsfJzs/STzLrhDIM5I/AAAAAAAAGOU/QXWUYB0eCa0/s200/IMG_0252.jpg"></a><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_L6DiZQsfJzs/STzLxoYLM7I/AAAAAAAAGOc/FGM2aiGgSzk/s1600-h/IMG_0253.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_L6DiZQsfJzs/STzLxoYLM7I/AAAAAAAAGOc/FGM2aiGgSzk/s200/IMG_0253.jpg"></a><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_L6DiZQsfJzs/STzL1VaQmlI/AAAAAAAAGOk/1ezbtAe9AdQ/s1600-h/IMG_0255.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_L6DiZQsfJzs/STzL1VaQmlI/AAAAAAAAGOk/1ezbtAe9AdQ/s200/IMG_0255.jpg"></a></div><p>Although I am an avid coffee drinker... I think you can tell that I like to drink the .NET kool-aid too :)</p>
