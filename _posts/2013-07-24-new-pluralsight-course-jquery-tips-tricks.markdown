It was an honor to work alongside Dan and to get to know him better in the process.<br><br><blockquote>"jQuery provides a powerful set of features that can be used to build applications but do you know some of the key tips, tricks and best practices that can be used to reduce code, promote re-use and simplify maintenance? In the <a href="http://manor.im/etm-ps-jqtat" target="_blank">jQuery Tips and Tricks</a> course Dan Wahlin and Elijah Manor will walk you through key tips and tricks learned over the years of building applications with jQuery. Topics covered include tips and tricks related to working with the DOM, handling and triggering events, making Ajax calls, working with and caching data locally, as well as taking advantage of built-in jQuery utility functions."</blockquote><br>You might be wondering how the above course is different from another course I recently published called <a href="http://bit.ly/etm-ps-fcjqb">Fixing Common jQuery Bugs</a>. The new course focuses on showing best practices when using jQuery and revealing some of the hidden and underlying concepts. Whereas, my previous course teaches from another viewpoint. The fixing bugs course tries to focus on issues that you might run into and then uncover what is going on and how to fix the problem. There is a little overlap, but the majority of the content is different between the two courses.<br><br>I hope you enjoy the courses and thanks for those that have watched or are going to watch!
