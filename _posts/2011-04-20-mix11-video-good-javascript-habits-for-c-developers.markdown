Thanks to everyone who voted my talk, I was able to present again at Mix again this year. In my presentation I reviewed some common problems that C# developers tend to make when moving to the JavaScript language. The languages look very similar, but they are very much different and knowing these differences is key!

You can view the recorded session above. The conference was jam packed with great sessions and many times it was difficult to pick which one to attend. Fortunately, all the sessions were recorded and Mix did a great job about publishing the videos only a few days after recording. 

Throughout the presentation I list several resources that you might want to dig into and research for yourself.
