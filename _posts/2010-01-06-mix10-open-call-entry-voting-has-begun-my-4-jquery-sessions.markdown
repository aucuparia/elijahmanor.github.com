At the end of the voting they will choose 10 sessions with the highest votes to be added to their conference. The winners of the selected proposals will be announced January 18, 2009.</p>  <p>You can view a <a href="http://visitmix.com/opencallvote/" target="_blank">comprehensive list of sessions</a> or a <a href="http://visitmix.com/opencallvote/?query=Elijah%20Manor" target="_blank">filtered list of just my 4 jQuery sessions</a> on the Mix10 website. There are 162 sessions and 92 speakers represented in the voting. You are able to vote for 5 sessions during your ballet submission. How do I know those stats… well, because I’m a geek and ran some jQuery in the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1843" target="_blank">FireBug</a> console ;)</p>  <pre>var uniqueSpeaker = [];<br>var speakerSelection = $('table tr td:nth-child(2) a');<br>speakerSelection.sort().each(function(i) {<br>   var speaker = $(this).text();<br>   speaker = speaker.replace(/^\s+|\s+$/g,"")<br>   if (uniqueSpeaker[speaker] === undefined) {<br>      uniqueSpeaker[speaker] = 1; <br>   } else {<br>      uniqueSpeaker[speaker] += 1;<br>   }<br>});<br><br>var numberOfUniqueSpeakers = 0;<br>for(var key in uniqueSpeaker) {<br>   console.log(key + ': ' + uniqueSpeaker[key] + ' sessions');<br>   numberOfUniqueSpeakers++;<br>};<br><br>console.log('Number of Sessions: ' + speakerSelection.length);<br>console.log('Number of Unique Speakers: ' + numberOfUniqueSpeakers);</pre> <p><strong>Note</strong>: If you actually wanted to run the above script you will need to <a href="http://www.learningjquery.com/2006/12/jquerify-bookmarklet" target="_blank">jQueryify</a> the <a href="http://visitmix.com/opencallvote/" target="_blank">Mix10 Open Call Entries</a> webpage since it doesn’t have jQuery referenced. The <a href="http://www.learningjquery.com/2006/12/jquerify-bookmarklet" target="_blank">jQueryify</a> bookmarklet inject jQuery into a webpage that doesn’t already have it referenced.</p> <p>Speaking of jQuery, the 4 session that I submitted to Mix10 are jQuery related…</p> <blockquote>  <h3><a href="http://visitmix.com/opencallvote/Entry?entryId=THINGS096" target="_blank">6 Things Every jQuery Developer Must Know</a></h3>   <p>An overview of several in-depth concepts that developers need to learn to bring their jQuery development to the next level.</p>   <p>We will review 6 things that you should know such as "What Is This?", "Am I Referencing the jQuery Object or a DOM Element", "Understanding Selectors", "Combine and Minify Your Scripts", "Different Ways of Storing Data", and "The Dos And Don'ts of Events". </p>   <p>Along the way, I'll share several helpful websites and tools to make your job as a jQuery developer easier.</p></blockquote> <p></p> <blockquote>  <h3><a href="http://visitmix.com/opencallvote/Entry?entryId=HOWTOD097" target="_blank">How to Debug Your jQuery Code</a></h3>   <p>In the past 10 years, more and more Web development has moved off the server and migrated to the browser, making a user's experience more responsive. Unfortunately, this transition hasn't always been pleasant for developers. The good news is that tooling Front-End debugging is much better.</p>   <p>We will examine some necessary tools for development such as FireBug and several other helpful tools. Our main focus will be on Debugging Selectors, Debugging Events, and Debugging Chains. During the session we'll review some common scenarios and how to debug them. </p></blockquote> <p></p> <blockquote>  <h3><a href="http://visitmix.com/opencallvote/Entry?entryId=CUSTOM098" target="_blank">Custom jQuery Events and Selector Filters</a></h3>   <p>jQuery has a wide variety of events and selectors that it already supports. Despite the rich functionality jQuery provides, you will eventually come to a spot where you need some event or selector that it doesn't support. The good news is that jQuery has made it easy to extend the library to support custom events and selectors.</p>   <p>In this session we are going to take a look at some of the existing events and selectors that jQuery makes available and then we will move on to show how we can extend jQuery to support our own custom needs.</p>   <p>Along the way, we will touch on what Event Driven Programming means and how custom jQuery events can make your code abide by the Open Closed Principle.</p></blockquote> <p></p> <blockquote>  <h3><a href="http://visitmix.com/opencallvote/Entry?entryId=JQUERY099" target="_blank">jQuery Test Driven Development</a></h3>   <p>The concept of Unit Testing has been around for quite some time in the development world, but it's adoption in the JavaScript arena has been quite low.</p>   <p>In this session, we will examine a jQuery Unit Testing framework and a JavaScript Mocking framework to assist you in your Front-End Browser Unit Tests.</p>   <p>You can also use the discipline of Test Driven Development as you build out new jQuery and JavaScript functionality.</p>   <p>We will also examine how to integrate these Unit Tests into your Continuous Integration environment.</p></blockquote> <p>Of course I’d like for you to vote for one or more of my jQuery sessions above (click the <a href="http://visitmix.com/opencallvote/?query=Elijah%20Manor" target="_blank">Vote For Our Session Submission</a> image above), but in addition I recommend you also look at the sessions by the following individuals…</p> <ul><li><a href="http://visitmix.com/?query=K.%20Scott%20Allen">K.
