<p>As many of you are aware, I am a frequent Tweeter and regularly distribute Web Developer technology related links for .NET and jQuery via my <a href="http://elijahmanor.com/category/Tech-Tweets.aspx" target="_blank">Tech Tweets</a>.</p>  <p>Historically, my main concern was to just gather the latest web dev news and <a href="http://elijahmanor.com/category/Tech-Tweets.aspx" target="_blank">Tech Tweet</a> those out to the public. </p>  <p>However, more and more many of these posts are just round-ups of other posts with little or no commentary. These posts tend to clutter the interwebs with noise that makes it difficult to find the real gems of web development.  </p>  <p>A combination of a recently article entitled <a href="http://j.mp/5X851U" target="_blank">Smashing Magazine Killed The Community (Or Maybe It Was Me)</a> and the input of several individuals that I respect inspired me to change how I am Tech Tweeting.</p>  <p>I put out an informal poll on Twitter and here were the results…</p>  <p><a href="http://answers.polldaddy.com/poll/2339959/?view=results" target="_blank"><img title="TopjQueryPluginPoll" border="0" alt="TopjQueryPluginPoll" src="http://elijahmanor.com/webdevdotnet/image.axd?picture=TopjQueryPluginPoll.png" width="600" height="460"></a> </p>  <p>The funny thing is that most of the responses were either in total support of the posts or in total opposition to the posts. </p>  <p>So what now? That is a good question. I’m not sure if you have noticed, but I have dramatically decreased the amount of round-up posts that I tweet. </p>  <p>If a blog post matches one or more of the following criteria it is most likely not going to be tech tweeted anymore…</p>  <ol><li>The title of the blog post starts with a number (example: “Top 10 jQuery Plug-in…”) </li>    <li>If the blog post contains a series of screenshots from other websites without any original content </li> </ol><ol>Over the past couple of weeks I have been saving jQuery posts that I’ve not tweeted matching the above criteria. Thus far I have 22 rejected blog posts! </ol><p>For those of you who voted that you liked the round-up posts, I still plan to post those blog posts, but only those that are of the highest quality and hopefully provide some sort of original content such as sample code, pros & cons, personal thoughts, etc…</p>  <p>My goal is to aid the jQuery community, not work against it ;)</p>  <p><strong>Note</strong>: If you have any feedback about the above post or how I can improve <a href="http://elijahmanor.com/category/Tech-Tweets.aspx" target="_blank">Tech Tweets</a>, please let me know.</p>  <p>Now for listening enjoyment...</p>  <div><div><div> <ul><li><a title="Video Killed the Radio Star" href="http://www.ilike.com/artist/The+Buggles/track/Video+Killed+the+Radio+Star">Video Killed the Radio Star</a> by <a href="http://www.ilike.com/artist/The+Buggles/The+Buggles">The Buggles</a></li> </ul></div>  </div><div><div>More <a href="http://www.ilike.com/artist/The+Buggles">The Buggles</a> music on <a href="http://www.ilike.com/">iLike</a></div></div></div>
