For those of you who would like more control of your HTML output from ASP.NET 2.0, then check out the newly updated <a href="http://www.asp.net/cssadapters/">CSS Adapters Beta 2</a>.<br><br>At one point I looked into using "CSS Adapters Beta 1" because the native asp:Menu HTML output does not work well with all browsers ( mainly Safari ). However, my direction was altered in another direction that didn't need the asp:Menu control, so Safari compatibility with the menu was no longer an issue.<br><br>Anyway, I know there are some hardcore CSS gurus who will do anything they can to not use tables for non-tabular data. If that describes you, or if you'd just like a little more control of your HTML output, then check out the <a href="http://www.asp.net/cssadapters/">CSS Adapters Beta 2</a>.
