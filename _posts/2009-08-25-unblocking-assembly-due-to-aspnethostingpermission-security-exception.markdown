<p>Ok, I am one of those strange birds who jumped over Windows Vista and went straight from Windows XP to Window 7, so I haven’t had the pleasure to experience many of the security features that supposedly protect the user from themselves. </p>  <p>After banging my head on the proverbial wall one too many times, I finally figured out the cause of a Security Exception I was getting while trying to add <a href="http://xval.codeplex.com/">xVal</a> Validation Framework into my <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=d34f9eaa-fcbe-4e20-b2fd-a9a03de7d6dd&displaylang=en">ASP.NET MVC v2 Preview 1</a> project.</p>  <blockquote>   <p>“System.Security.SecurityException: Request for the permission of type 'System.Web.AspNetHostingPermission, System, Version=2.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089' failed.”</p> </blockquote>  <p><a href="http://elijahmanor.com/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/UnblockingAssemblyDuetoAspNetHostingPerm_8705/SecurityException_2.png"><img title="SecurityException" border="0" alt="SecurityException" src="http://elijahmanor.com/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/UnblockingAssemblyDuetoAspNetHostingPerm_8705/SecurityException_thumb.png" width="604" height="413"></a> </p>  <p>It appears that Windows 7 (and from what I’ve heard Windows Vista also does this as well) attempted to protect me from a potential threat! When looking at the file properties dialog of the xVal.dll there was a security message at the bottom stating…</p>  <blockquote>   <p>“This file came from another computer and might be blocked to help protect this computer.”</p> </blockquote>  <p><a href="http://elijahmanor.com/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/UnblockingAssemblyDuetoAspNetHostingPerm_8705/UnblockAssembly_2.png"><img title="UnblockAssembly" border="0" alt="UnblockAssembly" align="left" src="http://elijahmanor.com/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/UnblockingAssemblyDuetoAspNetHostingPerm_8705/UnblockAssembly_thumb.png" width="355" height="484"></a>It turns out that all I had to do is click the “Unblock” button next to the message, remove & readd my Visual Studio project reference, and viola my problems were solved!</p>  <p>Next time, I hope not to waste half my day trying to figure this out. If you have not already faced this pain, I hope that you don’t have to in the future, or that this post will help you resolve it quickly!</p>
