<a href="http://appendto.com/"><img align="right" alt="appendToLogo" border="0" src="http://appendto.com/sites/all/themes/appendto/images/appendTo-logo.png" title="appendToLogo"></a>As you may or may not seen on Twitter the last 3 weeks or so, I accepted an offer to work with <a href="http://appendto.com/" target="_blank">appendTo, LLC - The Company Dedicated to jQuery</a> where I will be doing <a href="http://appendto.com/services/javascript-consulting" target="_blank">JavaScript Consulting</a> as well as other activities.<br><br>I first met the CEO (<a href="http://twitter.com/mikehostetler" target="_blank">Mike Hostetler</a>) and President (<a href="http://twitter.com/jdsharp" target="_blank">Jonathan Sharp</a>) of appendTo back in January while I was at the launch of jQuery 1.4 in Washington DC.<br><br>After the unfortunate turn of events at my last job (raided by the FBI & IRS), I was forced to look for a new job opportunity.<br><br>One of the first places I thought of working for was appendTo. After several weeks of talks everything worked out and now I am an official employee!<br><br>Since I’ve started I’ve done some writing, did an architectural review of a client’s code, and most recently I’ve been diving deep in developing a JavaScript and jQuery library. <br><br>I am really excited about this opportunity. The group of people that I work alongside are top notch! I find it impressive that appendTo has 5 official jQuery Team members working for them.<br><br>It looks like I’ll be able to attend the <a href="http://blog.jquery.com/2010/08/24/jquery-conference-2010-boston-announcement/" target="_blank">Boston jQuery Conference</a> this coming October 16-17, 2010. I hope to see you there! <a href="http://blog.jquery.com/2010/08/24/jquery-conference-2010-boston-announcement/" target="_blank">Sign up</a> while tickets last.<br><br><blockquote>By the way, thank all of you who sent me job leads, contacting me about working with you, or tweeted on my behalf while I was looking for a job. I appreciate all your efforts!</blockquote>
