<p>Today’s screencast is the 3rd in a series of developer Firefox Extensions. You can view my previous 2 short <a href="http://screenr.com/user/elijahmanor" target="_blank">Screenr</a> screencasts here… </p>  <ul><li><a href="http://elijahmanor.com/webdevdotnet/post/Firefinder-Add-on-for-Firebug-Add-on-for-Firefox.aspx" target="_blank">Firefinder for Firebug for Firefox for Fiddling with jQuery</a> </li>    <li><a href="http://elijahmanor.com/webdevdotnet/post/Digging-Into-The-FireQuery-Add-on-for-jQuery.aspx" target="_blank">Digging Into The FireQuery Add-on for jQuery</a> </li> </ul><p>You will most likely be asked to speed up the performance of some web page whether it be your corporate, personal, or some other web page. There are so many things that can cause a web page to be perceived as slow that it is helpful to have a tool to give you a guideline of where to start.  </p>  <p>Fortunately, there are two great tools for the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1843" target="_blank">Firebug</a> Add-on for <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/firefox.html" target="_blank">Firefox</a> that do performance checking of any given web page. The tools we will be looking at in the following screencast are <a href="http://code.google.com/speed/page-speed/" target="_blank">Google’s Page Speed</a> and <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yslow/" target="_blank">Yahoo’s YSlow</a> Add-ons. </p>   <p> </p>  <p>Yet again, I hope this was beneficial to you. If you enjoyed the presentation I would appreciate either a comment to this blog &| a tweet about it to share with others.</p>  <blockquote>   <p><a href="http://twitter.com/home?status=%22Page+Speed+%26+YSlow+Firebug+Extensions+2+Increase+Web+Page+Performance%22+by+%40elijahmanor+%23tech+%23nettuts+%23webdev+%23screencast+http%3A%2F%2Fj.mp%2F7IFWJ" target="_blank">"Page Speed & YSlow Firebug Extensions 2 Increase Web Page Performance" by @elijahmanor #tech #nettuts #webdev #screencast http://j.mp/7IFWJ</a></p> </blockquote>  <p>Also, if you have any suggestions that you have to help become a better presenter I would appreciate that as well.
