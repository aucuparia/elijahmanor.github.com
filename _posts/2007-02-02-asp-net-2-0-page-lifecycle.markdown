A while back I was looking for a detailed explanation of ASP.NET 2.0's Page LifeCycle. After a bit of searching I finally ran across an <a href="http://blog.rioterdecker.net/photos/images/picture113.aspx">excellent chart</a> created by Leon Andrianarivony.<br><br>His chart is the best visual depiction of ASP.NET 2.0's Page LifeCycle that I have seen yet. I'd be interested in any others you might have seen or created.
