You may have seen the buzz yesterday about the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2013/01/14/microsoft-security-bulletin-ms13-008-critical.aspx">Critical Microsoft Security Hot-fix (MS13-008)</a>. The hot-fix applies to a security issue in Internet Explorer versions 6 through 8. Newer version of IE (9 and 10) are not in danger.

<h3>
Upgrade to IE9-10 Instead</h3>

You could apply the above hot-fix to your existing old version of Internet Explorer, but why? Why not go ahead and <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/ie/aa740471.aspx">upgrade to IE9 or IE10</a>?

Not only will you get more features and a faster browser, but you will also be pushing the web forward. Developers will thank you for having one less oldIE browser to support. The nice thing about IE9-10 is that they follow web standards, which means code that is written to follow standards and practices should just work in IE9-10 and other modern browsers.

<blockquote>
Note: IE10 is only available as a Preview release on Windows 7 as of now. A full RTM release of IE10 should be released in the near future. Be warned, if you do install IE10 Preview on Win7 it will replace your IE9 browser.</blockquote>

<h3>
Others are dropping oldIE (IE6-8)</h3>

Others are following suite. <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/14/google-apps-says-goodbye-to-internet-explorer-pulls-support-for-the-browser/">Google Apps</a> recently decided to drop oldIE a while back and only support IE9+ and other modern browsers. 

In addition popular JavaScript libraries like jQuery are now dropping oldIE support in their <a href="http://blog.jquery.com/2013/01/15/jquery-1-9-final-jquery-2-0-beta-migrate-final-released/">upcoming 2.0 release</a>. After jQuery dropped oldIE support an interesting realization came about. Here is a quote from the jQuery Blog...

<blockquote>
"jQuery 2.0 now has more patches and shims for Chrome, Safari, and Firefox than for Internet Explorer!" -- <a href="http://blog.jquery.com/2013/01/14/the-state-of-jquery-2013/">http://blog.jquery.com/2013/01/14/the-state-of-jquery-2013</a></blockquote>

So, what are you waiting for? Upgrade to a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/ie/aa740471.aspx">new version of IE</a> today!
