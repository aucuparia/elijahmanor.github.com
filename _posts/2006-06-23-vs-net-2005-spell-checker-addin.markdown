My boss found a misspelling on our website yesterday.<br><br>So, I thought I'd look around for a Visual Studio.NET 2005 spell checker addin.<br><br>I found the following tools... <a href="http://www.dotnet2themax.com/ShowContent.aspx?ID=ded748ac-f681-4976-9623-71f5f3e3ea8f">Spell Checker for VS.NET 2005 Version 1.0 Add-in</a> by Dean J. Giovanelli and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/mikhailarkhipov/archive/2006/04/17/577471.aspx">Spell Checker for HTML and ASP.NET pages</a> by Mikhail Arkhipov<br><br>The tools have a lot of settings so they don't spell check things you aren't concerned about.<br><br>Using one of the above tools I was able to find the spelling mistake and correct it. I hope you find the above tools useful as well.
