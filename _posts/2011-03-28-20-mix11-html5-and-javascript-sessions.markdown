---

This year I will be attending the <a href="http://live.visitmix.com/" target="_blank">Microsoft Mix Conference</a> again in Las Vegas (April 12-14 2011). There were a lot of great sessions last year and there appear to be many more scheduled for this year.

I have listed 20 sessions (in alphabetical order) that I hope to attend if the schedule permits, otherwise I'll just catch the videos that will be posted shortly after they are presented.

In addition to these sessions I'm also looking forward to the Future of the Web <a href="http://live.visitmix.com/Keynotes" target="_blank">keynotes</a> by Scott Guthrie, Dean Hachamovitch, Joe Belfiore.

If you are already going or plan to attend after seeing these great sessions, then I hope to see you there! It should be another great conference! See <a href="http://live.visitmix.com/mix11" target="_blank">http://live.visitmix.com/mix11</a> for more details...

<a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/events/MIX/MIX11/EXT07" target="_blank">Designer and Developer: A Case for the Hybrid</a></h3>
<i>Jeff Croft</i>
<p>
Should designers code? Or is is okay for one to specialize in visual design and expect others to build their vision? As we get farther and farther away from the days of the "webmaster," and become an industry of specialists, are we losing some of the beauty, efficiency, and innovation that can be found at the point where design and development intersect? Jeff Croft, hybrid designer and developer, makes the case that the best web products will always be created by designers who understand the building blocks of the web: the code.</p>

<a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/events/MIX/MIX11/OPN08" target="_blank">Good JavaScript Habits for C# Developers</a></h3>
<i>Elijah Manor</i>
<p>
It seems that far too many people come to jQuery thinking that their previous knowledge with object-oriented languages like C# or Java will help them be successful at client-side scripting. In many cases, you can be successful with this approach, however, the more JavaScript you write you will inevitably find yourself uncovering strange bugs because you didn't take time to learn JavaScript properly. This session is targeted for developers that use jQuery, but haven’t invested adequate time to learn some of the foundational JavaScript concepts that differ from C#. If you would like to avoid some of these common mistakes when bringing your existing expertise to JavaScript, then please join me as I try to explain some of the differences.</p>

<a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/events/MIX/MIX11/RES02" target="_blank">JavaScript Panel</a></h3>
<i>Luke Hoban, Allen Wirfs-Brock, Tomasz Janczuk and Doug Crockford</i>
<p>
JavaScript is one of the most widely used general purpose functional, dynamic and prototype-based object-oriented programming languages on the web with considerable amounts of JS even running outside of the browser in other hosts. The language has matured and is currently in version 5 (officially, this is known as EcmaScript 5). Where did it come from? What problems was it initially designed to solve? How has it managed to scale to so many different usage scenarios? What are these scenarios, exactly? What does EC5 add to the language and what specific problems do these new additions solve? What's missing from the language? How will it evolve? How general purpose is JavaScript, really? The folks who will be on stage can answer all of these questions, but most importantly, YOU will drive the panel with your own questions. What do you want to know? What's the most burning question you have in your mind related to JavaScript? Answers await.</p>

<i>James Mickens</i>
<p>
Microsoft Research is working on several cool ways to make web applications faster and more robust. In this session, James Mickens will describe two projects that leverage JavaScript to improve web programs running on unmodified, commodity browsers. His talk will focus on Silo, a system that exploits DOM storage and AJAX to make web pages load more quickly. He’ll also describe Mugshot, a framework which allows developers to capture and replay JavaScript application bugs that users encounter in the wild. Neither project requires users to install a plugin or otherwise change their browser.</p>

<i>Damian Edwards</i>
<p>
jQuery turned the world on its ear. Do we still write JavaScript or do we just write jQuery? Damian will answer that question with new JavaScript techniques and AJAX as well as some jQuery plugin surprises up his sleeve. What are the best libraries and practices for using jQuery and JavaScript with ASP.NET? How should balanced applications be designed to make the best use of the power of the server and the power of the client?</p>

<a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/events/MIX/MIX11/HTM07" target="_blank">Reactive Extensions for JavaScript (RxJS)</a></h3>
<i>Bart De Smet</i>
<p>
Nobody likes sluggish web interfaces that get stuck when interacting with servers and services. Asynchrony has become the way of life to enhance user experiences. The A in AJAX pinpoints this observation precisely. Moreover, the sheer amount of asynchronous data sources is overwhelming: stock tickers, Twitter quotes, RSS feeds, you name it. Unfortunately, the programmability story for each of those sources differs significantly, with little to no unification or compositionality. Got tired of writing cumbersome code with plenty of callbacks, tedious logic and tricky error handling? Enter the Reactive Extensions, a library to seamlessly compose all kinds of asynchronous “reactive” data streams using LINQ-style query operators, available for both .NET and JavaScript (RxJS). Come and learn how Rx will make your life as a web developer easier when dealing with the asynchronous reality of modern web programming.</p>

<a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/events/MIX/MIX11/HTM09" target="_blank">The View of the World Depends on the Glasses I Wear</a></h3>
<i>Thomas Lewis</i>
<p>
There is no mobile Web, there is no desktop Web, and there is no tablet Web. We view the same Web just in different ways. So how do we do it? Sitting next to HTML5 is its friend CSS3 with its support for Media Queries. Media Queries let you customize your web experience based on parameters of display, device, properties and more. If you are a designer or front-end developer, come to this session to explore the sheer brutality of CSS3 Media Queries.</p>
