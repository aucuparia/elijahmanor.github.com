Today I recorded a Webinar with <a href="http://www.devexpress.com/">DevExpress</a> entitled "Good C# Habits Can Encourage Bad JavaScript Habits". The webinar is embedded below.<br><br>The talk was spurred by a recent Fornt-end Architecture Review I performed where the background of the developers was primarily C#. The project was almost entirely written in JavaScript and I noticed a common set of bad JavaScript practices that appeared to have their influence in good C# techniques.<br><br><div><div>These thoughts turned into a series of articles that I posted several months ago on <a href="http://bit.ly/dDaY8B">Enterprise jQuery</a> and I have recently pooled the articles into the following presentation.</div></div><br>I hope that this presentation will help you prevent some of these mistakes in your projects and to let you know, I've made all these mistakes myself :)<br><br><br><br><h3>           Resources</h3><div><br></div>At the end of the presentation I list several resources that you might want to dig into and research for yourself. <br><br><b>Slides and Articles</b><br><ul><li>I have hosted the <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/200135/talks/csharp-encourage-bad-javascript.html">slides from the video</a>. I utilized an HTML5 Presentation tool and the slides are best viewed using either Google Chrome or Firefox. </li><li>The article series this video was based on can be found on <a href="http://bit.ly/dDaY8B">Enterprise jQuery</a></li></ul><b>Tools</b><br><ul><li><a href="http://jslint.com/">JSLint.com</a> by Douglas Crockford</li></ul><b>Books</b><br><ul><li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Good-Parts-Douglas-Crockford/dp/0596517742">JavaScript: The Good Parts</a> by Douglas Crockford</li><li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Patterns-Stoyan-Stefanov/dp/0596806752">JavaScript Patterns</a> by Stoyan Stefanov</li></ul><b>Articles</b><br><ul><li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/scriptjunkie/ff852808.aspx">Prototypes and Inheritance in JavaScript</a> by <a href="http://twitter.com/odetocode">Scott Allen</a></li><li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/scriptjunkie/ff696765.aspx">Use Cases for JavaScript Closures</a> by <a href="http://twitter.com/kangax/">Juriy Zaytsev</a></li><li><a href="http://blog.boyet.com/blog/javascriptlessons/">JavaScript for C# Programmers</a> series by <a href="http://draft.blogger.com/post-create.g?blogID=30404818">Julian Bucknall</a></li></ul><b>Video</b><br><ul><li><a href="http://yuiblog.com/crockford/">Crockford on JavaScript</a> video series on Yahoo!</li></ul><span><br></span><span>Mix 11 Conference</span><br><br>If you like this topic, then please consider <a href="http://bit.ly/etm-mix11-vote">voting</a> for it to be included in the <a href="http://live.visitmix.com/">Microsoft Mix 11</a> conference by clicking the following tweet.
