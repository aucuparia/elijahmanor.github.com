So, you might have seen the following tweet from me a few days ago...

<blockquote>Turning over a new leaf on Monday <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23spoilers&src=hash">#spoilers</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23newjob&src=hash">#newjob</a><br>â€” Elijah Manor (@elijahmanor) <a href="https://twitter.com/elijahmanor/statuses/383689251382370304">September 27, 2013</a></blockquote>

Well, today is the day! I started a new full-time job with...

<strong>The Lampo Group</strong>! If that doesn't ring a bell, then think <strong><a href="http://www.daveramsey.com/home/" target="_blank">Dave Ramsey</a>'s</strong> company ;)

<div><a href="http://www.developwithpurpose.com/" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="81" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_SZ9aeiSi64/UklhM3Brk_I/AAAAAAAAgQU/1gMU_2F7pPI/s400/dave-with-purpose.png" width="400"></a></div><br>During the past year there has been a lot of transition for me. I worked with the great talent at <a href="http://appendto.com/">appendTo</a>, then decided to start my own business and made several training videos with <a href="http://pluralsight.com/training/Authors/Details/elijah-manor">Pluralsight</a>.

I've known about Dave Ramsey for several years. We have been through his <a href="http://www.daveramsey.com/fpu" target="_blank">Financial Peace University</a> course years ago and it is what prompted us to pay off our vehicles, credit card debts, and completely get out of debt excluding our house.

Someone I went to college with works for Dave and has been there 6 or 7 years, which is very rare in our field. Over time I've met more and more people that also work there and love it. 

Historically the developers at Dave Ramsey have been generalists working both on the front-end and back-end, but recently I saw a tweet from <a href="https://twitter.com/devwithpurpose">@devwithpurpose</a> saying that they were looking for a Front-End Web Developer specialist... and HEY, that describes me!

So, I applied and over a several month interview process they offered me the position. I am very excited for many reasons...

* Getting back to a regular consistent work schedule
* Getting to work on Front-End Web Development
* Getting to work on something that has a bigger purpose and is based on Biblical principles
* Getting to work somewhere where there is a history of longevity
* Getting to work alongside some very talented developers and designers
