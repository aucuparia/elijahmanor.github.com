On Wednesday, 05/29/2013 at 1:45pm I will present a session titled <a href="http://fluentconf.com/fluent2013/public/schedule/detail/27839">Angry Birds of Modern JavaScript Development</a>.

This is not your ordinary session, I've tried to mix things up by having each Angry Bird represent an area of JavaScript along with its strengths. Some topics covered include code organization, events and messaging, MV* frameworks, prototyping and mocking, design patterns, linting, and build systems. The goal is to defeat the pigs and by doing so produce highly tested quality JavaScript code.

<blockquote>
A diabolical herd of pigs stole all of the front-end architecture from an innocent flock of birds and now they want it back! A team of special agent hero birds will attack these despicable pigs until they recover what is rightfully theirs, front-end architecture!

The Red Birds attacks with the force of their trusty IIFE, the basic building block of all privacy. The Blue Bird follows in his footsteps and triggers events and messages that scatter to infiltrate the pig’s castle. The Yellow Bird comes with a Require.JS speed booster and dynamically injects scripts against those pesky swine. The Black Bird is soon to follow and he provides a much more organized approach to fighting these porkers and introduces the Backbone.js bomb to their dismay. The White Bird appears to be seemingly harmless, but when it pulls out it’s strict coding style and bursts of quality checks the hogs are sure to squeal. The Green Bird can reach all of those hard to reach places and will mock and spy those stealing swine right where it hurts! The Orange Bird starts out small with a simple template, but then expands itself into a DOM blast that will surely send the message that the birds mean business. The Big Brother is not too far behind and he is pulling out the big guns with his finite state machine and other proven design patterns of destruction. The Mighty Eagle pulls up the ranks with a superior weapon of them all, a suite of tools that can organize and deploy all the other birds into battle against their soon to be be vanquished foe.</blockquote>

In addition to the previous FluentConf workshop and session I also lead <a href="http://appendto.com/training/">Virtual Live Trainings</a> for <a href="http://appendto.com/">appendTo</a>. 

If your company is interested in a private remote training experience on JavaScript, jQuery, Backbone.js, Underscore.js, RequireJS, or other web technologies please e-mail <a href="mailto:training@appendto.com">training@appendto.com</a> for more information.

Here are some of the benefits of a Virtual Live Training (VLT)
<ul>
<li>Virtual Live Trainings can be located worldwide. I've performed numerous trainings both in the United States and overseas.</li>
<li>Virtual Live Trainings are cheaper than our On-Site Trainings because there is no additional cost for travel or hotel fees.</li>
<li>Virtual Live Trainings are well suited for 1/2 day trainings over a week duration enabling the students to gradually absorb the knowledge and also remain productive at their day job.</li>
<li>Virtual Live Trainings can be scheduled quicker than an On-Site Training since there is no travel involved.</li>
<li>Virtual Live Trainings get the same content and labs as an On-Site Training and to make it feel more personable I stream video of myself as well as my screen.</li>
</ul>
