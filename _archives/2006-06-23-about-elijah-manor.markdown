<p>Thanks for clicking the URL from my Twitter account.  If you haven't already, I’d love to connect with you via my <a href="http://twitter.com/elijahmanor" target="_blank">@elijahmanor</a> twitter account.</p><p>Instead of just launching you into one of my websites... I thought I'd give you a little background on who I am and what I do.</p><blockquote>I am a Christian married to my wonderful wife, Andrea. We are blessed to have two children Abby (3 years) and Enoch (9 months). I attend the Fellowship Bible Church in Brentwood, TN and I work for Compuware as a consultant developing Web Applications using Microsoft ASP.NET 3.5, MVC, AJAX, jQuery, Silverlight, and the works!</blockquote><p>If you haven't noticed already I'm kind of a <a href="http://twitterholic.com/elijahmanor/" target="_blank">Twitterholic</a> and I tend to tweet quite often on Twitter. I have recieved a <a href="http://followcost.com/elijahmanor">Nuclear Follow Cost</a> on more than one occasion.</p><p>I am aware that not all my followers are .NET fanatics, so I try to spread out non-.NET tweets throughout the day as well. I loosely try to stick with this schedule during business hours...</p><ul><li>1 tweet per hour (7:00am, 8:00am, etc...) about topics such as ASP.NET, ASP.NET MVC, Silverlight, etc...</li>   <li>1 tweet per hour (7:30am, 8:30am, etc...) about topics such as jQuery, JavaScript, CSS, etc...</li></ul><p>Many people ask me how in the world do I tweet all the time? Well, the trick is that I don't :) Every night or early in the morning I sift through my hundreds of RSS feeds, sort through several topic streams in Twitter using <a href="http://www.tweetgrid.com/" target="_blank">TweetGrid</a>, and compile a list of resources I find most helpful. I then schedule out these tweets using <a href="http://tweetlicious.codeplex.com/" target="_blank">Tweetlicious</a>. </p><p>If you are interested in following me, but are leary because of the volume of my tweets, then you may want to consider one of the following options.</p><ul><li><a href="http://zi.ma/techtweets" target="_blank">Search</a> for my technical tweets on Twitter anytime you want</li>   <li>Add an <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search.atom?q=+%23tech+from%3Aelijahmanor" target="_blank">RSS feed</a> via Twitter to my technical tweets</li>   <li>Or check out my <a href="http://delicious.com/elijahmanor" target="_blank">delicious account</a> where I automatically post my tech tweets</li></ul><h3>Connect with Me</h3><p>Thanks for visiting my about page. If you’ve not already don’t forget to follow me on <a href="http://twitter.com/elijahmanor">Twitter</a> so we can interact there.</p><!-- I’m also relatively active on other social media sites like Facebook, LinkedIn, Digg, StumbleUpon and FriendFeed. -->
