# Eliminate JavaScript Code Smells

## Title

> Eliminate JavaScript Code Smells

## Description (unpublished notes)

> This talk is intended to go beyond basic linting (JSLint/ESLint/JSHint) techniques and dig further into JavaScript anti-pattern code smells. The gist of the session is to identify common code smells and to introduce patterns to assist when refactoring.

## Abstract

> Have you ever written JavaScript that reeked, but you couldn't quite figure out why? Or have you written code and immediately knew that it wasn't good, but didn't know a better way?

> Your JavaScript may pass JSHint, but that doesn't mean it's legit.

> "A code smell is a surface indication that usually corresponds to a deeper problem in the system" --Martin Fowler

> Most developers can smell brittle and fragile code a mile away, but it takes time and training to combat against these smells. Code smells scream to be refactored.

> In this session we will discuss various common smelly code snippets and discuss techniques on how we can eliminate and protect against their pungent odors creeping into your codebase.
