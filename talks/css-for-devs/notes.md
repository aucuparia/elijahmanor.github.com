When you describe the pendulum a slide similar to your ealrier Positions table would be fantastic. Something that shows traditional css all the way to the write-it-all-in-js approach.

Notes from Beebs

Hacks are actually best practices in some cases so don't feel bad

Functions in sass

Add good mixin then show ide plugin then show autopreefixed

Embed sass compat

End of Bem talk about score of 1 and show circles

Why is Bem all calluses and when do you nest or should you nest. Complex selectors?

Summary use this approach easier to read, manage, low score

Unit testing

Visually regression
