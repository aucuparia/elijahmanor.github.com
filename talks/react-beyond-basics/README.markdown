## Beyond the Basics with React

## Build

Then, to start up the local server, run `npm start`

Open a browser and hit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), and we are ready to roll

Building the dist version of the project is as easy as running `npm run build`

If you want to deploy the slideshow to surge, run `npm run deploy`


## Description

This talk is meant for developers who have a basic understanding of React and are able to create basic React components. I build off of the basics and div into intermediate and advanced considerations

## Short Description

Now that you have a basic understanding of React, let's push forward and explore some more advanced topics such as using a flux architecture, High Order Components, immutability, testing libraries, performance concerns, and pattern library creation.

## Abstract

Getting started with React doesn't take too long, but there are a whole lot of other concerns that come along that you, as a developer, will need to understand and tackle. After this session you will be exposed to concepts that are helpful when creating a large front-end application such as using a flux architecture, applying High Order Components, assessing performance concerns, integrating immutability, leveraging helpful unit testing libraries, and creating your own component pattern library.

## Outline

* Flux Architecture
* Applying High Order Components
* Assessing performance concerns
* Integrating immutability
* Using Flow
* Webpack
* Leveraging helpful unit testing libraries
* Creating your own component pattern library.
