### What is it?

based on toxic shame / keep to self / think that noone else suffers
strangely many are very influencial because it pushes them to learn

### Ways to Counteract

Find a mentor
Open to Peers
become content
write down accomplishments / keep a journal
learn because you love to learn (not out of shame or to prove something)
