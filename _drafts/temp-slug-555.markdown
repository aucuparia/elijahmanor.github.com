# JavaScript Library Overload

There is a plethora of JavaScript libraries out on the internet and it seems like a new one is cropping up just about every day. How is one supposed to know what library is good and if it should be considered for your next project? Questions like these can be difficult and costly depending on the answer.

## Criteria for a good JavaScript Library

We will address some of the main things to look for when considering a JavaScript library. Even if you choose a good set of libraries there is another risk that they may not work well together or a library will cease to exist. We will unpack these concepts and others as we survey the JavaScript library landscape.

1. Active Project

2. Good Documentation

3. Ample Unit Tests

4. Vibrant Community

6. Integration Hooks

7. Extensible

8. Trusted Author(s)

### Good Documentation

Having a helpful and solid library is great, but if you don't have documentation then it could be the downfall for your JavaScript library.

Yes, it takes a while to build good documentation, but it is one of the many things that sets a library apart from others. In many cases, not having sufficient documentation can turn off or turn away prospective users.

Problems with documentation is that they typically get out of date or they are either too high level or too low level in their detail. In addition, developers learn in different ways. Often times having a short video tutorial to cover the high level basics is a good way to get started.

Video is great for a first time visitor, but once someone has already watched the video they usually just want to access the content of the video in textual format. So, having this information available in a semi-redundant way is actually very helpful.

### Unit Tests

### Open Source

### Vibrant Community

To gauge the community support and popularity for these three frameworks we looked at data from GitHub, Stack Overflow and Twitter and plotted the level of community support based on parameters like:

All time contributors
All time commits
Active pull requests comprising of both merged and proposed (for 1 month)
Tagged questions on Stack Overflow
Tweets per day (for 1 month)


### Easy to Extend

### Focused Purpose

### Conclusion 

As we discuss these strategies we will look at various libraries that conform to these guidelines and examine why they are successful, why they continue to be active, and why you should consider using them in your projects.

NOTES:

I plan to cover the following topics as I describe a "Good JavaScript Library".

1. Active Project
2. Good Documentation
3. Ample Unit Tests
4. Vibrant Community
6. Integration Hooks
7. Extensible
8. Trusted Author(s)

The ideas covered address either a specific focused library (micro-library) or a large framework with lots of bells and whistles. My intent isn't to say "You should use XYZ library", however, it is to describe the things I look for when picking a library (whether large or small) for a project. 

Once a library is integrated into your project you create a dependency on it and if it doesn't meet many of the above criteria, then it could end up being a painful relationship in the future. 

I find myself regularly using a set of rules to "assess" a project before using it. I also want to discuss the risks if a library doesn't meet one or more of these criteria. For example, if the project hasn't been maintained for a while or if there is only one main contributor, then you as a consumer may need to accept the risk of taking over the project or fixing bugs as they arise in your application. I've seen too many projects where the creator changes passions or gets to busy with other projects. 

I'll be presenting this talk at https://anglebrackets.org/ earlier in the week (November 10-13).
