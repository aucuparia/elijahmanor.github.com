title: From Ghost to Jekyll

So, I was using the Node.js Ghost blogging engine for over a year and it was going pretty well. The biggest frustration for me was updating the engine to the lasted version on my host server. I've upgraded several times and each time ended up being much more work than I had intended.

I had a scare moment where I almost lost years of blog posts. Thankfully I had several recent back-ups because the latest one failed, but that is another story.

Anyway, I figured it was time to switch to a statically generated blog engine, which is where Jekyll comes into the story. I have several friends who use Jekyll for their blogs and they enjoy it. I'm not a Ruby developer, but you don't really have to be to use Jekyll.

I've found that the documentation was pretty good and my favorite part is that GitHub Pages know about Jekyll! I can push to GitHub the raw Jekyll files and GitHub will generate the static blog for me... AUTOMAGICALLY!
