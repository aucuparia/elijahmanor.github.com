![](/assets/images/2014/Mar/logo_9624cbf4ef800b9827861e67259e1f5c.png) I've been using GitHub's [Atom](https://atom.io/) editor for the past couple of weeks and I've really enjoyed it. At first there weren't very many extensions/packages available, but the community has been quick to fill in that gap.

You can browse the packages [online](https://atom.io/packages) or from Atom's Preferences... (âŒ˜,)

<img src="/assets/images/2015/Jun/react-to-the-future-intro.png" style="float: left; width: 300px; margin: 0 1em 1em 0; padding: 0;" /> I recently gave a talk about [Facebook's React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) library at [AngleBrackets](https://anglebrackets.org/) in Scottsdale, AZ. The talk, [**React to the Future**](http://elijahmanor.com/talks/react-to-the-future/), is an introduction to React and then I start to touch on some larger concepts like Flux and Isomorphic JavaScript.

<img src="/assets/images/2015/Jun/reactjs-with-elijah-manor.png" style="float: left; width: 300px; margin: 0 1em 1em 0; padding: 0;" /> I was recently interviewed on the [Polymorphic Podcast](http://polymorphicpodcast.com/shows/react) by [Craig Shoemaker](http://twitter.com/craigshoemaker).

On the show we talk about many of the above concepts in addition to topics like integrating React into an existing Brown-field project, etc...
