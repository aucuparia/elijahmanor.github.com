Yesterday I spoke at FluentConf, a great conference by O'Reilly.

I presented on *[Eliminate JavaScript Code Smells](http://elijahmanor.github.io/talks/js-smells)*, a newer talk I created this year. The talk was well receied and I had a good number of disucssions about it aftwards in person and on Twitter. Thanks to all who attended and reached out to me.
